10.8. Refund policy

As a user of one of our apps / games you are a customer of the retailer app store (eg. Apple or Google) where you have downloaded the app / game. All app stores have their own refund policies that you have agreed to by downloading and using their app store and entering your credit card data. Cardholder can also limit the possibility of making in-app purchases / micro transactions within apps and games on devices holding his or her credit card data.

As a default, as a customer of one of the aforementioned retailer app stores, all refund requests must be made according to their policies and they will make their own decisions.

In case a minor has been using a credit in an unauthorized fashion to make purchases that amount to a considerable monetary value and the cardholder is requesting a refund in excess of the retailer's policies, we will view each case individually. In order to view the case in detail, cardholder need to supply all the payment receipts and codes for individual purchases.

In the case that FarmMiner makes a refund, it also includes closing down the account(s) on the device(s) used to make those purchases. In the case of a refund, FarmMiner withholds a sum of 200€ to cover the expenses. Accordingly sums of less than 200€ will not be refunded. Even in the case of a refund, FarmMiner cannot refund the retailer's share of the transaction value, usually 30% of the net value of the purchase.

In case a minor has used your credit card in an unauthorized fashion in one of our games, email info@socialfirstgames.com
